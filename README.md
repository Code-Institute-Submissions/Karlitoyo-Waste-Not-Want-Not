**Waste Not Want Not** - ***ReadMe***

This website is designed to allow users to upload items they have within their household or in their possession.

The planned final form of the Website is to be an auction sytle platform with charitable donations built into the 
user experience, partner charities recieve a donation from either of the individual seller or the auction site 
administrators monthly / yearly donation as a percentage of revenue.

The website is broken down into 4 main pages, as detailed below -

"Home, Catalogue, Get Involved, Contact"

---Home---

The home page is a simplifies user interface providing a simple search bar which is planned to link to the Catalogue 
page. The UX has been simplified to allow for ease of use and to encourage users to search the Catalogue. In future 
versions I would anticipate top items being placed below the search bar for quick user access to items in demand within
the Catalogue.

---Catalogue---

The Catalogue page is the main repository of items available on the website. Users can browse the Catalogue of available
items and in planned future versions view prices related to individual items and place bids as auctions are live. 
The responsiveness of multiple images which flip to reveal price , name and description proved challenging however
it is good for tablet and desktop monior + large monitor.

---Get Involved---

The Get Involved section allows users to register on the website and provide a brief description of the item they 
wish to upload to the site. In planned future versions an image upload section will be active allowing upload of
items upon successfull registration.

---Contact---

The Contact section provides useful contact information for queries users may have including an e-mail address
and contact number. This section also provides a brief synopsis of the individuals behind the website.


---Coding language---

Within my code I have used HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. I have utilised a number of resources to complete my 
first milestone project most notably the book "Sams Teach Yourself - HTML,CSS,JavaScript (third edition). 
I have also referenced the sites - W3 Schools, Stack Overflow, Slack, FreeCodeCamp. For my search bar I have linked
the specific link below to the creator. I customised the CSS to reflect how I wished it to look. The code below will
produce a magnifying icon however I ammended this to produce the circle shown within my home page also changing colors
as appropriate.

Neomorphism was the initial design concept for the UI. My navigation bar is an ode to this sytle however due to general
restrictions on my current design capabilities and color scheme this was rolled back. I have provided links below to
both.
